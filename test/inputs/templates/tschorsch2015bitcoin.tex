\bibentry{tschorsch2015bitcoin}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
Besides attracting a billion dollar economy  Bitcoin revolu- tionized the field of digital currencies and influenced many adjacent areas. This also induced significant scientific inter- est. In this survey  we unroll and structure the manyfold results and research directions. We start by introducing the Bitcoin protocol and its building blocks. From there we continue to explore the design space by discussing existing contributions and results. In the process  we deduce the fun- damental structures and insights at the core of the Bitcoin protocol and its applications. As we show and discuss  many key ideas are likewise applicable in various other fields  so that their impact reaches far beyond Bitcoin itself.
