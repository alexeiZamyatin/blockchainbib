\section{On Decentralizing Prediction Markets and Order Books}
\bibentry{clark2014decentralizing}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
We propose techniques for decentralizing prediction markets and order books, utilizing
Bitcoinâ€™s security model and consensus mechanism. Decentralization of prediction markets offers several
key advantages over a centralized market: no single entity governs over the market, all transactions are
transparent in the block chain, and anybody can participate pseudonymously to either open a new
market or place bets in an existing one. We provide trust agility: each market has its own specified
arbiter and users can choose to interact in markets that rely on the arbiters they trust. We also provide
a transparent, decentralized order book that enables order execution on the block chain in the presence
of potentially malicious miners.
