\section{Increasing Anonymity in Bitcoin}
\bibentry{saxena2014increasing}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
Bitcoin prevents double-spending using the blockchain   a public  ledger  kept  with  every  client.  Every  single  transaction  till  date  is present in this ledger. Due to this  true anonymity is not present in bit- coin. We present a method to enhance anonymity in bitcoin-type cryp- tocurrencies.  In  the  blockchain   each  block  holds  a  list  of  transactions linking the sending and receiving addresses. In our modifyed protocol the transactions (and blocks) do not contain any such links. Using this  we obtain a far higher degree of anonymity. Our method uses a new primi- tive known as composite signatures . Our security is based on the hardness of the Computation Die-Hellman assumption in bilinear maps.
