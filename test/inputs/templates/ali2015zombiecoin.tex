\section{ZombieCoin: powering next-generation botnets with bitcoin}
\bibentry{ali2015zombiecoin}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
Botnets are the preeminent source of online crime and arguably the greatest threat to the Internet infrastructure.
In this paper, we present ZombieCoin, a botnet command-and-control (C\&C) mechanism that runs on the Bitcoin network. 
ZombieCoin offers considerable advantages over existing C\&C techniques, most notably the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist the very regulatory processes currently used to combat botnets. We believe this is a desirable avenue botmasters may explore in the near future and our work is intended as a first step towards devising effective countermeasures.
