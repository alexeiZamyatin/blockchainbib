\section{Analysis of Hashrate-Based Double Spending }
\bibentry{rosenfeld2014doublespending}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
Bitcoin ([?]) is the worldâ€™s first decentralized digital currency. Its main technical innovation is the use of a blockchain and hash-based proof of work to synchronize transactions and prevent double-spending the currency. While the qualitative nature of this system is well understood, there is widespread confusion about its quantitative aspects and how they relate to attack vectors and their countermeasures. In this paper we take a look at the stochastic processes underlying typical attacks and their resulting probabilities of success.
