\section{Cryptographic Currencies from a Tech-Policy Perspective: Policy Issues and Technical Directions }
\bibentry{mcreynolds2015cryptographic}

\textbf{Abstract:} 
We study legal and policy issues surrounding crypto currencies, such as Bitcoin, and how those issues interact with technical design options. With an interdisciplinary team, we consider in depth a variety of  issues  surrounding  law,  policy,  and  crypto  currencies | such  as  the physical location where a crypto currency's value exists for jurisdictional and other purposes, the regulation of anonymous or pseudonymous currencies, and challenges as virtual currency protocols and laws evolve. We reflect  onhow  different  technical  directions  may  interact  with  the  relevant  laws  and  policies,  raising  key  issues  for  both  policy  experts  and technologists.
